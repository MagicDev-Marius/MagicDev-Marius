### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student from Germany and I like to code.

My favourite languages are `Java`, `JavaScript` (and a lot `Typescript`) and `Kotlin`. Also I dont like `C`/`C++` (but I use it lol) ðŸ˜‰

Idk what I could or should say here but yeah...

Check out these repositories:
* [angular-app-creator](https://github.com/MagicDev-Marius/angular-app-creator)
* [buildsys](https://github.com/MagicDev-Marius/buildsys)

Also I like coding with [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/)
