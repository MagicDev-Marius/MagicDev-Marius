### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student from Germany and I like to code.

My favourite languages are `Java`, `JavaScript` (and a lot `Typescript`), `Kotlin` and, although the syntax is very much shit, `C++` ðŸ˜‰

Idk what I could or should say here but yeah...

Check out these repositories:

* [buildsys](https://github.com/MagicDev-Marius/buildsys)
* [Notes](https://github.com/avolgha/Notes/)

Also I like coding with [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/)
